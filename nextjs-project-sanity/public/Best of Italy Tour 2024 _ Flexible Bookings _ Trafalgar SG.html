Glimpse the Benedictine Abbey of Cassino perched high on the mountain peak, known as the site of the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944 before heading north to the slopes of Mount Subasio. Arrive in the mystical town of Assisi, the birthplace of St. Francis, under whose protection this medieval city is said to remain. Join your Local Specialist for a visit of Basilica of St. Francis, before some free time to explore this fascinating hilltop town. Tonight, you'll stay at one of Trafalgar’s Stays With Stories – a fully renovated old Franciscan monastery.</p></p></header></div></div><div class="wrapper-icon-section"><div class="loading-component-overlay" data-testid="loading-component-overlay"><div class="loading-component-overlay__children" data-testid="loading-component-overlay-children"><div class="accommodation accommodation--thumbnail"><div class="accommodation__content"><div class="accommodation__box accommodation__box--single"><div class="accommodation__information"><div class="icon-text icon-text--left" data-testid="icon-text"><span data-testid="icon-text-icon" class="icon-wrapper"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="21" height="20" viewBox="0 0 21 20" fill="none" class="injected-svg icon icon-text__icon" data-src="/assets/shared/icons/tt-moon.svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">

Your MAKE TRAVEL MATTER® Experience with the glassblowing artisans of Venice follows. Watch as they share their centuries-old glassmaking traditions. Your visit helps to preserve this delicate craft for which Venice is justifiably famous and you’ll want to remember your visit by purchasing a souvenir or two to display at home. From there, continue past the Bridge of Sighs and the Doge's Palace to St. Mark's Square to view the impressive square and Basilica. Consider an optional experience to see the colourful fishermen's houses on the Island of Burano or search for a cosy bacaro and indulge in some tasty Venetian treats, starting with that refreshing Venetian Spritz which is the local drink of choice.</p></p></header></div></div><div class="wrapper-icon-section"><div class="loading-component-overlay" data-testid="loading-component-overlay"><div class="loading-component-overlay__children" data-testid="loading-component-overlay-children"><div class="accommodation accommodation--thumbnail"><div class="accommodation__content"><div class="accommodation__box accommodation__box--single"><div class="accommodation__information"><div class="icon-text icon-text--left" data-testid="icon-text"><span data-testid="icon-text-icon" class="icon-wrapper"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="21" height="20" viewBox="0 0 21 20" fill="none" class="injected-svg icon icon-text__icon" data-src="/assets/shared/icons/tt-moon.svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
